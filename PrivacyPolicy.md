# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: January 2026**

Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains what data the **AntiScam Bot** collects and how it is handled.

## 1. Data Collection
The Bot collects the following information when a command is used:
- **Submitted URLs:** The links you provide for scanning via the `/scan` command.
- **User/Server IDs:** Discord identifiers to facilitate the response and prevent command abuse.
- **Interaction Data:** Which buttons are clicked (e.g., "Why?", "How to Block?").

## 2. Data Usage
We use this data to:
- Perform security analysis of the submitted URL.
- Generate visual screenshots of the website (via third-party APIs).
- Improve the Bot's detection logic.

## 3. Data Sharing
We do **not** sell your data. However, to perform its function, the Bot shares the submitted URL with:
- **Google Safe Browsing API** (to check for known threats).
- **ScreenshotAPI.net** (to generate the visual preview).
- **Discord** (to display the results).

## 4. Data Retention
- **Screenshots:** Images generated by the Bot are stored by the third-party screenshot provider according to their retention policy (usually 30 days).
- **Logs:** We may keep temporary logs of scanned URLs to debug the Bot's performance. These are deleted periodically.

## 5. Contact
If you have questions about how your data is handled, please contact the Bot developer via Discord.
